    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one day
    // or create a new array and concat the old one 
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); //Example one - surface copy

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); //Example two - described as the "poor Man's deep clone"

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
